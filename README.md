# HoeffdingD.jl
HoeffdingD.jl is a Julia package implementing in pure Julia the Hoeffding measure of dependence as it was described in the original paper: [A Non-Parametric Test of Independence](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-19/issue-4/A-Non-Parametric-Test-of-Independence/10.1214/aoms/1177730150.full) in particular chapter 5. The package also implements the D-test of independence described in chapter 9 of the same paper. 

The advantage of this statistic is to detect nonlinear relationships that Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation are unable to detect.
